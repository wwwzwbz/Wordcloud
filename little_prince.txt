Antoine De Saint-Exupery \
\
Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who was a French author, journalist and pilot wrote \
The Little Prince in 1943, one year before his death. \
\
The Little Prince appears to be a simple children\'92s tale, \
some would say that it is actually a profound and deeply moving tale, \
written in riddles and laced with philosophy and poetic metaphor. \
\
\
\
\
Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from \
Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an \
animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. \
\
In the book it said: \'93Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they \
are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.\'94 I \
pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a coloured \
pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: \
\
\
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. \
But they answered: \'93Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?\'94 My drawing was not \
a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown- \
ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa \
constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. \
\
My Drawing Number Two looked like this: \
\
The grown-ups\'92 response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa \
constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, \
history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a \
magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number \
One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is \
tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. \
\
So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I have flown a little over all \
parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can \
distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the \
course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been \
concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen \
them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn\'92t much improved my opinion of them. \
\
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of \
showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this \
was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: \'93That is a \
hat.\'94 Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I \
would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and \
neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man. \
\
So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my \
plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had \
with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all \
alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a \
week. \
\
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I \
was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can \
imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. \
\
\
\
\
It said: \'93If you please, draw me a sheep!\'94 \
\
\'93What!\'94 \
\
\'93Draw me a sheep!\'94 \
\
I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all \
around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with \
great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But \
my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. \
\
That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter\'92s career when I was \
six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from \
the inside. \
\
Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in \
astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. \
And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be \
fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child \
lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. \
\
When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: \'93But, what are you doing here?\'94 And in answer he \
repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: \
\
\'93If you please, draw me a sheep...\'94 \
\
When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a \
thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet \
of paper and my fountain pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on \
geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I \
did not know how to draw. He answered me: \'93That doesn\'92t matter. Draw me a sheep...\'94 \
\
\
\
\
But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It \
was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow \
greet it with, \'93No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a \
very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very \
small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep. \
\
\
\
\
So then I made a drawing. He looked at it carefully, then he said: \'93No. This sheep is already very \
sickly. Make me another.\'94 So I made another drawing. My friend smiled gently and indulgently. \
\'93You see yourself,\'94 he said, \'93that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns. \
\
\
\
\
So then I did my drawing over once more. But it was rejected too, just like the others. \'93This one is \
too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time. \
\
By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. \
So I tossed off this drawing. And I threw out an explanation with it. \
\
\'93This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.\'94 \
\
\
\
\
I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge: \
\
\'93That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of \
grass?\'94 \
\
\'93Why?\'94 \
\
\'93Because where I live everything is very small...\'94 \
\
\'93There will surely be enough grass for him,\'94 I said. \
\
\'93It is a very small sheep that I have given you.\'94 \
\
He bent his head over the drawing: \'93Not so small that, Look! He has gone to sleep...\'94 \
\
And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince. \
\
It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many \
questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, \
little by little, everything was revealed to me. \
\
The first time he saw my air-plane, for instance (I shall not draw my air-plane; that would be much \
too complicated for me), he asked me: \'93What is that object?\'94 \
\
\'93That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.\'94 And I was proud to have him \
learn that I could fly. He cried out, then: \'93What! You dropped down from the sky?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 I answered, modestly. \
\
\
\
\'93Oh! That is funny!\'94 And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me \
very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. \
\
Then he added: \'93So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?\'94 At that moment I caught \
a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: \'93Do you \
come from another planet?\'94 But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his \
eyes from my plane: \'93It is true that on that you can\'92t have come from very far away...\'94 And he \
sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried \
himself in the contemplation of his treasure. \
\
You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the \'93other planets.\'94 I \
made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject. \
\
\'93My little man, where do you come from? What is this \'91where I live,\'92 of which you speak? Where \
do you want to take your sheep?\'94 \
\
After a reflective silence he answered: \'93The thing that is so good about the box you have given \
me is that at night he can use it as his house.\'94 \
\
\'93That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, \
and a post to tie him to.\'94 \
\
But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: \'93Tie him! What a queer idea!\'94 \
\
\'93But if you don\'92t tie him,\'94 I said, \'93he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.\'94 \
\
My friend broke into another peal of laughter: \'93But where do you think he would go?\'94 \
\'93Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.\'94 \
\
Then the little prince said, earnestly: \'93That doesn\'92t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!\'94 \
And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: \'93Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far...\'94 \
\
\
\
\
I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince \
came from was scarcely any larger than a house! But that did not really surprise me much. I knew \
very well that in addition to the great planets, such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which \
we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has \
a hard time seeing them through the telescope. \
\
\
\
When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He \
might call it, for example, \'93Asteroid 325.\'94 \
\
\
\
\
I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid \
known as B-612. This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a \
Turkish astronomer, in 1909. \
\
On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical \
Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe \
what he said. Grown-ups are like that... \
\
Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his \
subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer \
gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time \
everybody accepted his report. \
\
If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on \
account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, \
they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, \'93What does his \
voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?\'94 Instead, they \
demand: \'93How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much \
money does his father make?\'94 \
\
Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. \
\
If you were to say to the grown-ups: \'93I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums \
in the windows and doves on the roof,\'94 they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. \
\
You would have to say to them: \'93I saw a house that cost $ 20,000.\'94 Then they would exclaim: \'93Oh, \
what a pretty house that is!\'94 Just so, you might say to them: \'93The proof that the little prince \
existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody \
wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.\'94 And what good would it do to tell them that? They \
would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: \'93The planet he \
came from is Asteroid B-612,\'94 then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their \
questions. They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show \
great forbearance toward grown-up people. But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a \
matter of indifference. \
\
I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: \
\'93Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger \
\
\
\
than himself, and who had need of a sheep...\'94 \
\
\
\
To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story. Fori \
do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down \
these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his \
sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend \
is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who \
are no longer interested in anything but figures... It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a \
box of paints and some pencils. \
\
It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those \
of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I \
shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of \
success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make \
some errors, too, in the little prince\'92s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. \
And I feel some doubts about the colour of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, \
now bad, and I hope generally fair-to- middling. In certain more important details I shall make \
mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything \
to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep \
through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old. \
\
As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince\'92s planet, his \
departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall \
from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the \
baobabs. \
\
This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly, as if \
seized by a grave doubt, \
\
\'93It is true, isn\'92t it, that sheep eat little bushes?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, that is true.\'94 \
\
\'93Ah! I am glad!\'94 \
\
I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little \
prince added: \'93Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?\'94 I pointed out to the little prince that \
baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he \
took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. \
\
The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh. \'93We would have to put them one on \
top of the other,\'94 he said. But he made a wise comment: \
\
\'93Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.\'94 \
\
\'93That is strictly correct,\'94 I said. \'93But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?\'94 \
\
He answered me at once, \'93Oh, come, come!\'94, as if he were speaking of something that was self- \
evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any \
assistance. \
\
Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived, as on all planets, good \
\
\
\
\
\
plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds \
from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth\'92s darkness, \
until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch \
itself and begin, timidly at first, to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the \
sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it \
might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first \
instant that one recognises it. \
\
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these \
were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is \
something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the \
entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the \
baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces... \
\
\'93It is a question of discipline,\'94 the little prince said to me later on. \
\
\'93When you\'92ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your \
planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, \
at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes, which they \
resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,\'94 the little prince added, \'93but \
very easy.\'94 And one day he said to me: \'93You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the \
children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they \
were to travel some day. \
\
\
\
\
Sometimes,\'94 he added, \'93there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But \
when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. \
\
I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes... So, as the \
little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take \
the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable \
risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking \
through my reserve. \'93Children,\'94 I say plainly, \'93watch out for the baobabs!\'94 My friends, like \
myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for \
them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. \
\
The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me. Perhaps you will \
ask me, \'93Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this \
drawing of the baobabs?\'94 The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been \
successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring \
force of urgent necessity. \
\
Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time \
you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. \
\
I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: \
\
\'93I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now.\'94 \
\
\'93But we must wait,\'94 I said. \
\
\'93Wait? For what?\'94 \
\
\'93For the sunset. We must wait until it is time.\'94 \
\
At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me: \
\'93I am always thinking that I am at home!\'94 \
\
Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. \
If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. \
Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you \
need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever \
you like... \
\
\'93One day,\'94 you said to me, \'93I saw the sunset forty-four times!\'94 \
\
And a little later you added: \'93You know, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad...\'94 \'93Were you so \
sad, then?\'94 I asked, \'93on the day of the forty-four sunsets?\'94 \
\
But the little prince made no reply. \
\
On the fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep, the secret of the little prince\'92s life \
was revealed to me. \
\
Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent \
meditation on his problem, he demanded: \'93A sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, \
too?\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\'93A sheep,\'94 I answered, \'93eats anything it finds in its reach.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Even flowers that have thorns?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, even flowers that have thorns.\'94 \
\
\'93Then the thorns, what use are they?\'94 I did not know. \
\
At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was \
very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was \
extremely serious. And I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear for the worst. \
\
\'93The thorns, what use are they?\'94 \
\
The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that \
bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: \'93The thorns are of no use at all. \
Flowers have thorns just for spite!\'94 \
\
\'93Oh!\'94 There was a moment of complete silence. \
\
Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: \'93I don\'92t believe you! \
Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure themselves as best they can. They \
believe that their thorns are terrible weapons...\'94 \
\
I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: \'93If this bolt still won\'92t turn, I am going to \
knock it out with the hammer.\'94 \
\
Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts. \'93And you actually believe that the flowers...\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, no!\'94 I cried. \'93No, no no! I don\'92t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that \
came into my head. Don\'92t you see, I am very busy with matters of consequence!\'94 \
\
He stared at me, thunderstruck. \'93Matters of consequence!\'94 \
\
He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine grease, bending \
down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly... \
\
\'93You talk just like the grown-ups!\'94 That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly: \
\'93You mix everything up together... You confuse everything...\'94 \
\
He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze. \
\
\'93I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He \
has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but \
add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: \'91I am busy with matters of \
consequence!\'92 And that makes him swell up with pride. \
\
\'93But he is not a man, he is a mushroom!\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93A what?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93A mushroom!\'94 The little prince was now white with rage. \'93The flowers have been growing thorns \
for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is \
it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow \
\
\
\
\
' ' \
\
I \\ \
\
\
\
\
thorns, which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not \
important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman\'92s sums? And if I know, \
I, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but \
which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is \
doing, Oh! You think that is not important! His face turned from white to red as he continued: \'93If \
some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of \
stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. \
\
He can say to himself, \'91Somewhere, my flower is there...\'92 But if the sheep eats the flower, in one \
moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think that is not important!\'94 \
\
He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing. The night had fallen. I had \
let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or \
death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I \
took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him: \'93The flower that you love is not in danger. I \
will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will...\'94 \
\
I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach \
him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more. \
\
It is such a secret place, the land of tears. \
\
I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince\'92s planet the flowers had always been \
very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to \
nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded \
peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come \
up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any \
other small sprouts on his planet. \
\
It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab. The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to \
get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge \
bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was \
not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She \
\
\
\
chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to \
go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her \
beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious \
adornment lasted for days and days. Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed \
herself. And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: \'93Ah! I am \
scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged...\'94 But the little \
prince could not restrain his admiration: \
\
\'93Oh! How beautiful you are!\'94 \
\
\'93Am I not?\'94 the flower responded, sweetly. \'93And I was born at the same moment as the sun...\'94 \
\
The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and \
exciting she was! \
\
\'93I think it is time for breakfast,\'94 she added an instant later. \'93If you would have the kindness to \
think of my needs\'94 And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can of \
fresh water. \
\
So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity, which \
was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. \
\
One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: \'93Let \
the tigers come with their claws!\'94 \
\
\'93There are no tigers on my planet,\'94 the little prince objected. \'93And, anyway, tigers do not eat \
weeds.\'94 \
\
\'93I am not a weed,\'94 the flower replied, sweetly. \'93Please excuse me...\'94 \'93I am not at all afraid of \
tigers,\'94 she went on, \'93but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn\'92t screen for me?" \
\
\'93A horror of drafts, that is bad luck, for a plant,\'94 remarked the little prince, and added to himself, \
\'93This flower is a very complex creature...\'94 \
\
\'93At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I \
came from...\'94 But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She \
could not have known anything of any other worlds. \
\
Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two \
or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong. \
\
\'93The screen?\'94 \
\
\'93I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me...\'94 \
\
Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So \
the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to \
doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very \
unhappy. \
\
\'93I ought not to have listened to her,\'94 he confided to me one day. \
\
\'93One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their \
\
\
\
\
fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. \
This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness \
and pity.\'94 \
\
And he continued his confidences: \'93The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I \
ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over \
me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay \
behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to \
love her...\'94 \
\
I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the \
morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active \
volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his \
breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, \'93One never \
knows!\'94 So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn \
slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney. \
\
On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring \
no end of trouble upon us. The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the \
last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last \
morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for \
the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he \
was very close to tears. \'93Goodbye,\'94 he said to the flower. But she made no answer. \'93Goodbye,\'94 \
he said again. The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold. \
\
\'93I have been silly,\'94 she said to him, at last. \'93I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy...\'94 He was \
surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held \
arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. \
\
\'93Of course I love you,\'94 the flower said to him. \'93It is my fault that you have not known it all the \
while. That is of no importance. But you, you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... let \
the glass globe be. I don\'92t want it any more.\'94 \
\
\'93But the wind...\'94 \'93My cold is not so bad as all that... the cool night air will do me good. I am a \
flower.\'94 \
\
\'93But the animals...\'94 \'93Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to \
become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the \
butterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me? You will be far away... as for the large \
animals, I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws.\'94 \
\
And, naively, she showed her four thorns. \
\
Then she added: \'93Don\'92t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!\'94 \
\
For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower... \
\
\
\
He found himself in the neighbourhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He \
began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge. The first of them was \
inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne, which was at \
\
\
\
\
the same time both simple and majestic. \
\
\
\
\'93Ah! Here is a subject,\'94 exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming. And the little \
prince asked himself: \'93How could he recognise me when he had never seen me before?\'94 \
\
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects. \'93Approach, \
so that I may see you better,\'94 said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king \
over somebody. \
\
The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed \
and obstructed by the king\'92s magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since \
he was tired, he yawned. \
\
\'93It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,\'94 the monarch said to him. \'93I forbid \
you to do so.\'94 \
\
\'93I can\'92t help it. I can\'92t stop myself,\'94 replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. \
\
\'93I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep...\'94 \
\
\'93Ah, then,\'94 the king said. \'93I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. \
Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order.\'94 \
\
\'93That frightens me... I cannot, any more...\'94 murmured the little prince, now completely abashed. \
\
\'93Hum! Hum!\'94 replied the king. \'93Then I... I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to\'94 He \
sputtered a little, and seemed vexed. For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his \
authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, \
because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable. \
\
\'93If I ordered a general,\'94 he would say, by way of example, \'93if I ordered a general to change \
himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the \
general. It would be my fault.\'94 \
\
\'93May I sit down?\'94 came now a timid inquiry from the little prince. \'93I order you to do so,\'94 the king \
answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle. But the little prince was \
wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule? \
\
\'93Sire,\'94 he said to him, \'93I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question\'94 \
\
\'93I order you to ask me a question,\'94 the king hastened to assure him. \'93Sire, over what do you \
rule?\'94 \'93Over everything,\'94 said the king, with magnificent simplicity. \
\
\'93Over everything?\'94 The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all \
the stars. \'93Over all that?\'94 asked the little prince. \'93Over all that,\'94 the king answered. For his rule \
was not only absolute: it was also universal. \'93And the stars obey you?\'94 \'93Certainly they do,\'94 the \
king said. \'93They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.\'94 \
\
Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete \
authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but \
seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his \
chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet, which he had forsaken, he \
plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour: \
\
\
\
\
\
\'93I should like to see a sunset... do me that kindness... Order the sun to set...\'94 \
\
\'93If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic \
drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he \
had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?\'94 the king demanded. \'93The general, or \
myself?\'94 \
\
\'93You,\'94 said the little prince firmly. \
\
\'93Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform,\'94 the king went \
on. \'93Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw \
themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience \
because my orders are reasonable.\'94 \
\
\'93Then my sunset?\'94 the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had \
asked it. \
\
\'93You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I \
shall wait until conditions are favourable.\'94 \
\
\'93When will that be?\'94 inquired the little prince. \'93Hum! Hum!\'94 replied the king; and before saying \
anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. \'93Hum! Hum! That will be about... about... that will be \
this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed.\'94 \
\
The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already \
beginning to be a little bored. \'93I have nothing more to do here,\'94 he said to the king. \'93So I shall set \
out on my way again.\'94 \'93Do not go,\'94 said the king, who was very proud of having a subject. \'93Do \
not go. I will make you a Minister!\'94 \'93Minister of what?\'94 \'93Minster of...of Justice!\'94 \'93But there is \
nobody here to judge!\'94 \'93We do not know that,\'94 the king said to him. \'93I have not yet made a \
complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me \
to walk.\'94 \'93Oh, but I have looked already!\'94 said the little prince, turning around to give one more \
glance to the other side of the planet. \
\
On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all... \'93Then you shall judge yourself,\'94 the king \
answered, \'93that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to j udge oneself than to \
j udge others. If you succeed in j udging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true \
wisdom.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said the little prince, \'93but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet. \
\'93Hum! Hum!\'94 said the king. \'93I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is \
an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him \
to death. Thus his life will depend on your j ustice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for \
he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have.\'94 \
\
\'93I,\'94 replied the little prince, \'93do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on \
my way.\'94 \'93No,\'94 said the king. But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for \
departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch. \'93If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly \
obeyed,\'94 he said, \'93he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for \
example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are \
favourable...\'94 As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. \
\
Then, with a sigh, he took his leave. \'93I made you my Ambassador,\'94 the king called out, hastily. \
\
He had a magnificent air of authority. \
\
\'93The grown-ups are very strange,\'94 the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey. \
The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man. \
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\'93Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!\'94 he exclaimed from afar, when he first \
saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the little prince. \'93That is a queer hat you are wearing.\'94 \
\
\'93It is a hat for salutes,\'94 the conceited man replied. \'93It is to raise in salute when people acclaim \
me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.\'94 \
\
\'93Yes?\'94 said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about. \
\
\'93Clap your hands, one against the other,\'94 the conceited man now directed him. The little prince \
clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute. \'93This is more entertaining \
than the visit to the king,\'94 the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, \
one against the other. The conceited man against raised his hat in salute. After five minutes of \
\
\
\
this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game\'92s monotony. \'93And what should one do to \
make the hat come down?\'94 he asked. But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people \
never hear anything but praise. \
\
\'93Do you really admire me very much?\'94 he demanded of the little prince. \'93What does that mean, \
\'91admire\'92?\'94 \
\
\'93To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the \
most intelligent man on this planet.\'94 \'93But you are the only man on your planet!\'94 \'93Do me this \
kindness. Admire me just the same.\'94 \
\
\'93I admire you,\'94 said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, \'93but what is there in that to \
interest you so much?\'94 \
\
And the little prince went away. \'93The grown-ups are certainly very odd,\'94 he said to himself, as he \
continued on his journey. \
\
The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. \
\
\
\
\
This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection. \'93What are you \
doing there?\'94 he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of \
empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles. \
\
\'93I am drinking,\'94 replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air. \
\
\'93Why are you drinking?\'94 demanded the little prince. \
\
\'93So that I may forget,\'94 replied the tippler. \'93Forget what?\'94 inquired the little prince, who already \
was sorry for him. \
\
\'93Forget that I am ashamed,\'94 the tippler confessed, hanging his head. \
\
\'93Ashamed of what?\'94 insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him. \
\
\'93Ashamed of drinking!\'94 The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an \
impregnable silence. \
\
And the little prince went away, puzzled. \'93The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,\'94 he said to \
himself, as he continued on his journey. \
\
The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. \
\
This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince\'92s arrival. \
\
\
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 the little prince said to him. \'93Your cigarette has gone out.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good \
morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven\'92t \
time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew ! Then that makes five-hundred- \
and-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.\'94 \
\
\'93Five hundred million what?\'94 asked the little prince. \'93Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and- \
one million, I can\'92t stop... I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I \
don\'92t amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven...\'94 \
\
\'93Five-hundred-and-one million what?\'94 repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of \
a question once he had asked it. \
\
The businessman raised his head. \'93During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I \
have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy \
goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over \
the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was \
disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don\'92t get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The \
third time, well, this is it! I was saying, then, five -hundred-and-one millions\'94 \
\
\'93Millions of what?\'94 The businessman suddenly realised that there was no hope of being left in \
peace until he answered this question. \
\
\'93Millions of those little objects,\'94 he said, \'93which one sometimes sees in the sky.\'94 \'93Flies?\'94 \'93Oh, \
no. Little glittering objects.\'94 \'93Bees?\'94 \'93Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle \
dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle \
dreaming in my life.\'94 \'93Ah! You mean the stars?\'94 \'93Yes, that\'92s it. The stars.\'94 \'93And what do you do \
with five-hundred millions of stars?\'94 \'93Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two \
thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am \
accurate.\'94 \
\
\'93And what do you do with these stars?\'94 \'93What do I do with them?\'94 \'93Yes.\'94 \'93Nothing. I own them.\'94 \
\'93You own the stars?\'94 \'93Yes.\'94 \'93But I have already seen a king who...\'94 \'93Kings do not own, they \
reign over. It is a very different matter.\'94 \
\
\'93And what good does it do you to own the stars?\'94 \'93It does me the good of making me rich.\'94 \
\
\'93And what good does it do you to be rich?\'94 \
\
\'93It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered.\'94 \
\
\'93This man,\'94 the little prince said to himself, \'93reasons a little like my poor tippler...\'94 Nevertheless, \
he still had some more questions. \'93How is it possible for one to own the stars?\'94 \'93To whom do they \
belong?\'94 the businessman retorted, peevishly. \'93I don\'92t know. To nobody.\'94 \'93Then they belong to \
me, because I was the first person to think of it.\'94 \'93Is that all that is necessary?\'94 \'93Certainly. \
\
When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that \
belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on \
it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning \
them.\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, that is true,\'94 said the little prince. \'93And what do you do with them?\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\'93I administer them,\'94 replied the businessman. \'93I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I \
am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.\'94 \
\
The little prince was still not satisfied. \'93If I owned a silk scarf,\'94 he said, \'93I could put it around my \
neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with \
me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven...\'94 \
\
\'93No. But I can put them in the bank.\'94 \'93Whatever does that mean?\'94 \'93That means that I write the \
number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.\'94 \
\
\'93And that is all?\'94 \
\
\'93That is enough,\'94 said the businessman. \
\
\'93It is entertaining,\'94 thought the little prince. \'93It is rather poetic. But it is of no great \
consequence.\'94 On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas, which were very different \
from those of the grown-ups. \
\
\'93I myself own a flower,\'94 he continued his conversation with the businessman, \'93which I water \
every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is \
extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, \
that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars...\'94 \
\
The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince \
went away. \'93The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,\'94 he said simply, talking to \
himself as he continued on his journey. \
\
The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for \
a street lamp and a lamplighter. \
\
\
\
\
The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a \
lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet, which had no people, and not one house. \
\
But he said to himself, nevertheless: \'93It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so \
absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has \
\
\
\
some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one \
flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful \
occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.\'94 \
\
When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter. \
\
\'93Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?\'94 \
\
\'93Those are the orders,\'94 replied the lamplighter. \'93Good morning.\'94 \
\
\'93What are the orders?\'94 \
\
\'93The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening.\'94 And he lighted his lamp again. \'93But why \
have you just lighted it again?\'94 \
\
\'93Those are the orders,\'94 replied the lamplighter. \
\
\'93I do not understand,\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93There is nothing to understand,\'94 said the lamplighter. \'93Orders are orders. Good morning.\'94 And \
he put out his lamp. \
\
Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares. \
\
\'93I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, \
and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the \
night for sleep.\'94 \
\
\'93And the orders have been changed since that time?\'94 \
\
\'93The orders have not been changed,\'94 said the lamplighter. \'93That is the tragedy! From year to \
year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!\'94 \
\
\'93Then what?\'94 asked the little prince. \
\
\'93Then the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second \
for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!\'94 \
\
\'93That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!\'94 \
\
\'93It is not funny at all!\'94 said the lamplighter. \'93While we have been talking together a month has \
gone by.\'94 \
\
\'93A month?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening.\'94 And he lighted his lamp again. As the \
little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. \
He remembered the sunsets, which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling \
up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend. \
\
\'93You know,\'94 he said, \'93I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to...\'94 \
\
\'93I always want to rest,\'94 said the lamplighter. For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at \
the same time. \
\
\
\
\
The little prince went on with his explanation: \'93Your planet is so small that three strides will take \
you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. \
When you want to rest, you will walk and the day will last as long as you like.\'94 \
\
\'93That doesn\'92t do me much good,\'94 said the lamplighter. \'93The one thing I love in life is to sleep.\'94 \
\
\'93Then you\'92re unlucky,\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93I am unlucky,\'94 said the lamplighter. \'93Good morning.\'94 And he put out his lamp. \
\
\'93That man,\'94 said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, \'93that man \
would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the \
businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. \
Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.\'94 \
\
He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: \'93That man is the only one of them all \
whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for \
two people...\'94 What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave \
this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets! \
\
The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who \
wrote voluminous books. \
\
\
\
\
\'93Oh, look! Here is an explorer!\'94 he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming. \
\
The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already travelled so much and \
so far! \
\
\'93Where do you come from?\'94 the old gentleman said to him. \
\
\'93What is that big book?\'94 said the little prince. \'93What are you doing?\'94 \
\
\'93I am a geographer,\'94 the old gentleman said to him. \
\
\'93What is a geographer?\'94 asked the little prince. \'93A geographer is a scholar who knows the \
location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.\'94 \
\
\'93That is very interesting,\'94 said the little prince. \'93Here at last is a man who has a real profession!\'94 \
And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. \
\
\
\
It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen. \
\
\'93Your planet is very beautiful,\'94 he said. \'93Has it any oceans?\'94 \
\
\'93I couldn\'92t tell you,\'94 said the geographer. \
\
\'93Ah!\'94 The little prince was disappointed. \'93Has it any mountains?\'94 \
\
\'93I couldn\'92t tell you,\'94 said the geographer. \
\
\'93And towns, and rivers, and deserts?\'94 \
\
\'93I couldn\'92t tell you that, either.\'94 \
\
\'93But you are a geographer!\'94 \
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 the geographer said. \'93But I am not an explorer. I haven\'92t a single explorer on my \
planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the \
seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He \
does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and \
he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them \
seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer\'92s moral character.\'94 \
\
\'93Why is that?\'94 \
\
\'93Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would \
an explorer who drank too much.\'94 \
\
\'93Why is that?\'94 asked the little prince. \
\
\'93Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a \
place where there was only one.\'94 \
\
\'93I know some one,\'94 said the little prince, \'93who would make a bad explorer.\'94 \
\
\'93That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry \
is ordered into his discovery.\'94 \
\
\'93One goes to see it?\'94 \
\
\'93No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, \
if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought \
back from it.\'94 The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement. \'93But you come from far away! \
You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!\'94 And, having opened his big register, \
the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One \
waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink. \'93Well?\'94 said the \
geographer expectantly. \
\
\'93Oh, where I live,\'94 said the little prince, \'93it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three \
volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows.\'94 \
\
\'93One never knows,\'94 said the geographer. \
\
\
\
\'93I have also a flower.\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\'93We do not record flowers,\'94 said the geographer. \
\
\'93Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!\'94 \
\
\'93We do not record them,\'94 said the geographer, \'93because they are ephemeral.\'94 \
\
\'93What does that mean \'91ephemeral\'92?\'94 \
\
\'93Geographies,\'94 said the geographer, \'93are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with \
matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain \
changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal \
things.\'94 \
\
\'93But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,\'94 the little prince interrupted. \
\
\'93What does that mean \'91ephemeral\'92?\'94 \
\
\'93Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,\'94 said the geographer. \
\'93The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.\'94 \
\
\'93But what does that mean \'91ephemeral\'92?\'94 repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go \
of a question, once he had asked it. \
\
\'93It means, \'91which is in danger of speedy disappearance.\'92 \'93 \
\
\'93Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?\'94 \
\
\'93Certainly it is.\'94 \
\
\'93My flower is ephemeral,\'94 the little prince said to himself, \'93and she has only four thorns to \
defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!\'94 \
\
That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more. \'93What place would you \
advise me to visit now?\'94 he asked. \'93The planet Earth,\'94 replied the geographer. \'93It has a good \
reputation.\'94 And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower. \
\
\
\
\
So then the seventh planet was the Earth. \
\
The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! \
\
One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 \
geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men, that is to say, \
about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. \
\
To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it \
was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 \
lamplighters for the street lamps. Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid \
spectacle. \
\
The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would \
come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, \
these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps \
in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the \
turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of \
South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order \
of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent. \
\
Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was \
responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and \
care: they would be busy twice a year. \
\
When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. \
\
I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realise \
that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. \
\
Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its \
surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public \
assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. \
All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet. \
\
The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill \
a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise \
them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do \
not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me. \
\
When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He \
was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the colour of the \
moonlight, flashed across the sand. \
\
\'93Good evening,\'94 said the little prince courteously. \
\
\'93Good evening,\'94 said the snake. \
\
\'93What planet is this on which I have come down?\'94 asked the little prince. \
\
\'93This is the Earth; this is Africa,\'94 the snake answered. \
\
\'93Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth?\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\'93This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large,\'94 said the snake. \
\
The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky. \
\
\'93I wonder,\'94 he said, \'93whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us \
may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!\'94 \
\
\'93It is beautiful,\'94 the snake said. \'93What has brought you here?\'94 \
\
\'93I have been having some trouble with a flower,\'94 said the little prince. \'93Ah!\'94 said the snake. And \
they were both silent. \
\
\'93Where are the men?\'94 the little prince at last took up the conversation again. \'93It is a little lonely \
in the desert...\'94 \
\
\'93It is also lonely among men,\'94 the snake said. The little prince gazed at him for a long time. \
\
\'93You are a funny animal,\'94 he said at last. \'93You are no thicker than a finger...\'94 \
\
\'93But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,\'94 said the snake. \
\
The little prince smiled. \'93You are not very powerful. You haven\'92t even any feet. You cannot even \
travel...\'94 \
\
\'93I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,\'94 said the snake. He twined himself around \
the little prince\'92s ankle, like a golden bracelet. \
\
\'93Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,\'94 the snake spoke again. \'93But \
you are innocent and true, and you come from a star...\'94 \
\
The little prince made no reply. \'93You move me to pity, you are so weak on this Earth made of \
granite,\'94 the snake said. \'93I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. \
I can...\'94 \
\
\'93Oh! I understand you very well,\'94 said the little prince. \'93But why do you always speak in \
riddles?\'94 \
\
\'93I solve them all,\'94 said the snake. And they were both silent. \
\
The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. \
\
It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the flower. \
\
\'93Where are the men?\'94 the little prince asked, politely. The flower had once seen a caravan \
passing. \
\
\'93Men?\'94 she echoed. \'93I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several \
years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no \
roots, and that makes their life very difficult.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Goodbye,\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\
\
\
\'93Goodbye,\'94 said the flower. \
\
\
\
After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were \
the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. \
\
\'93From a mountain as high as this one,\'94 he said to himself, \'93I shall be able to see the whole planet \
at one glance, and all the people...\'94 But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened \
like needles. \
\
\
\
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 he said courteously. \
\
\'93Good morning...Good morning...Good morning,\'94 answered the echo. \
\
\'93Who are you?\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93Who are you...Who are you...Who are you?\'94 answered the echo. \
\
\'93Be my friends. I am all alone,\'94 he said. \
\
\'93I am all alone...all alone. ..all alone,\'94 answered the echo. \
\
\'93What a queer planet!\'94 he thought. \'93It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether \
harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to \
them... On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak...\'94 \
\
But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little \
prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 he said. He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the roses. \
\
The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower. \
\
\'93Who are you?\'94 he demanded, thunderstruck. \
\
\'93We are roses,\'94 the roses said. And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that \
she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all \
alike, in one single garden! \
\
\'93She would be very much annoyed,\'94 he said to himself, \'93if she should see that... she would cough \
\
\
\
most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I \
should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble \
myself also, she would really allow herself to die...\'94 \
\
Then he went on with his reflections: \'93I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all \
the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to \
my knees \'97 and one of them perhaps extinct forever... that doesn\'92t make me a very great \
prince...\'94 And he lay down in the grass and cried. \
\
It was then that the fox appeared. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the fox. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw \
nothing. \
\
\'93I am right here,\'94 the voice said, \'93under the apple tree.\'94 \'93 \
\
Who are you?\'94 asked the little prince, and added, \'93You are very pretty to look at.\'94 \
\
\'93I am a fox,\'94 said the fox. \
\
\'93Come and play with me,\'94 proposed the little prince. \
\
\'93I am so unhappy.\'94 \'93I cannot play with you,\'94 the fox said. \'93I am not tamed.\'94 \
\
\'93Ah! Please excuse me,\'94 said the little prince. But, after some thought, he added: \'93What does \
that mean, \'91tame\'92?\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\'93You do not live here,\'94 said the fox. \'93What is it that you are looking for?\'94 \
\
\'93I am looking for men,\'94 said the little prince. \'93What does that mean, \'91tame\'92?\'94 \
\
\'93Men,\'94 said the fox. \'93They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise \
chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?\'94 \
\
\'93No,\'94 said the little prince. \'93I am looking for friends. What does that mean, \'91tame\'92?\'94 \
\
\'93It is an act too often neglected,\'94 said the fox. It means to establish ties.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93\'91To establish ties\'92?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Just that,\'94 said the fox. \'93To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a \
hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no \
need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you \
tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall \
be unique in all the world...\'94 \
\
\'93I am beginning to understand,\'94 said the little prince. \'93There is a flower... I think that she has \
tamed me...\'94 \
\
\'93It is possible,\'94 said the fox. \'93On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, but this is not on the Earth!\'94 said the little prince. The fox seemed perplexed, and very \
curious. \
\
\'93On another planet?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes.\'94 \
\
\'93Are there hunters on this planet?\'94 \
\
\'93No.\'94 \
\
\'93Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?\'94 \
\
\'93No.\'94 \
\
\'93Nothing is perfect,\'94 sighed the fox. But he came back to his idea. \'93My life is very monotonous,\'94 \
the fox said. \'93I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are \
just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun \
came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. \
Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of \
my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of \
no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that \
is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which \
is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the \
wheat...\'94 The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time. \'93Please, tame me!\'94 he said. \
\
\'93I want to, very much,\'94 the little prince replied. \'93But I have not much time. I have friends to \
discover, and a great many things to understand.\'94 \
\
\'93One only understands the things that one tames,\'94 said the fox. \'93Men have no more time to \
understand anything. They buy things all ready-made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere \
where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame \
me...\'94 \
\
\'93What must I do, to tame you?\'94 asked the little prince. \
\
\'93You must be very patient,\'94 replied the fox. \'93First you will sit down at a little distance from me, \
like that, in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. \
Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day...\'94 \
\
\
\
\
The next day the little prince came back. \
\
\
\
\'93It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\'94 said the fox. \'93If, for example, you \
come at four o\'92clock in the afternoon, then at three o\'92clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel \
happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o\'92clock, I shall already be worrying and \
jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never \
know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites...\'94 \
\
\'93What is a rite?\'94 asked the little prince. \
\
\'93Those also are actions too often neglected,\'94 said the fox. \'93They are what make one day \
different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my \
hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! \
I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day \
would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.\'94 \
\
So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near... \
\
\'93Ah,\'94 said the fox, \'93I shall cry.\'94 \
\
\'93It is your own fault,\'94 said the little prince. \'93I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted \
me to tame you...\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, that is so,\'94 said the fox. \
\
\'93But now you are going to cry!\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93Yes, that is so,\'94 said the fox. \
\
\'93Then it has done you no good at all!\'94 \
\
\'93It has done me good,\'94 said the fox, \'93because of the colour of the wheat fields.\'94 And then he \
added: \'93Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the \
world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.\'94 \
\
The little prince went away, to look again at the roses. \'93You are not at all like my rose,\'94 he said. \
\'93As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox \
when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made \
him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.\'94 And the roses were very much embarrassed. \
\'93You are beautiful, but you are empty,\'94 he went on. \'93One could not die for you. To be sure, an \
ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me. But \
in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she \
that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that \
I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except \
the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, \
when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my \
rose. \
\
And he went back to meet the fox. \'93Goodbye,\'94 he said. \
\
\'93Goodbye,\'94 said the fox. \'93And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the \
heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\'93What is essential is invisible to the eye,\'94 the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to \
remember. \
\
\'93It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\'94 \
\
\'93It is the time I have wasted for my rose...\'94 said the little prince, so that he would be sure to \
remember. \
\
\'93Men have forgotten this truth,\'94 said the fox. \'93But you must not forget it. You become \
responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose...\'94 \
\
\'93I am responsible for my rose,\'94 the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the railway switchman. \
\
\'93What do you do here?\'94 the little prince asked. \
\
\'93I sort out travellers, in bundles of a thousand,\'94 said the switchman. \'93I send off the trains that \
carry them; now to the right, now to the left.\'94 And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the \
switchman\'92s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder. \
\
\'93They are in a great hurry,\'94 said the little prince. \'93What are they looking for?\'94 \
\
\'93Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,\'94 said the switchman. And a second brilliantly \
lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction. \
\
\'93Are they coming back already?\'94 demanded the little prince. \'93These are not the same ones,\'94 said \
the switchman. \'93It is an exchange.\'94 \
\
\'93Were they not satisfied where they were?\'94 asked the little prince. \
\
\'93No one is ever satisfied where he is,\'94 said the switchman. And they heard the roaring thunder of \
a third brilliantly lighted express. \
\
\'93Are they pursuing the first travellers?\'94 demanded the little prince. \
\
\'93They are pursuing nothing at all,\'94 said the switchman. \'93They are asleep in there, or if they are \
not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the \
windowpanes.\'94 \
\
\'93Only the children know what they are looking for,\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody \
takes it away from them, they cry...\'94 \'93They are lucky,\'94 the switchman said. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the little prince. \
\
\'93Good morning,\'94 said the merchant. \
\
This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow \
one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink. \
\
\
\
\
\'93Why are you selling those?\'94 asked the little prince. \
\
\
\
\'93Because they save a tremendous amount of time,\'94 said the merchant. \'93Computations have been \
made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.\'94 \
\
\'93And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?\'94 \
\
\'93Anything you like...\'94 \
\
\'93As for me,\'94 said the little prince to himself, \'93if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I \
should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.\'94 \
\
It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story \
of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply. \
\
\'93Ah,\'94 I said to the little prince, \'93these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet \
succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if \
I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!\'94 \
\
\'93My friend the fox...\'94 the little prince said to me. \
\
\'93My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!\'94 \
\
\'93Why not?\'94 \
\
\'93Because I am about to die of thirst...\'94 \
\
He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: \'93It is a good thing to have had a friend, \
even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend...\'94 \
\
\'93He has no way of guessing the danger,\'94 I said to myself. \'93He has never been either hungry or \
thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs...\'94 \
\
But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought: \'93I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a \
well...\'94 I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity \
of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking. \
\
When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to \
come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The \
little prince\'92s last words came reeling back into my memory: \'93Then you are thirsty, too?\'94 I \
demanded. But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me: \'93Water may also be good \
for the heart...\'94 \
\
I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to \
cross-examine him. He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, \
he spoke again: \'93The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.\'94 \
\
I replied, \'93Yes, that is so.\'94 And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand \
that were stretched out before us in the moonlight. \
\
\'93The desert is beautiful,\'94 the little prince added. \
\
And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees \
\
\
\
\
\
nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams... \
\
\'93What makes the desert beautiful,\'94 said the little prince, \'93is that somewhere it hides a well...\'94 \
\
I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was \
a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, \
no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an \
enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart... \'93Yes,\'94 I \
said to the little prince. \'93The house, the stars, the desert \'97 what gives them their beauty is \
something that is invisible!\'94 \
\
\'93I am glad,\'94 he said, \'93that you agree with my fox.\'94 As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took \
him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me \
that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more \
fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of \
hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: \
\
\'93What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...\'94 \
\
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \'93What \
moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower \'97 the \
image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is \
asleep...\'94 \
\
And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a \
flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind... And, as I walked on so, I found the well, \
at daybreak. \
\
\'93Men,\'94 said the little prince, \'93set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what \
they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round...\'94 And he \
added: \'93It is not worth the trouble...\'94 \
\
\
\
The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are \
mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, \
and I thought I must be dreaming... \
\
\'93It is strange,\'94 I said to the little prince. \'93Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the \
rope...\'94 He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like \
an old weathervane, which the wind has long since forgotten. \
\
\'93Do you hear?\'94 said the little prince. \'93We have wakened the well, and it is singing...\'94 \
\
I did not want him to tire himself with the rope. \
\
\'93Leave it to me,\'94 I said. \'93It is too heavy for you.\'94 I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the \
well and set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still \
in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water. \
\
\'93I am thirsty for this water,\'94 said the little prince. \'93Give me some of it to drink...\'94 \
\
And I understood what he had been looking for. I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes \
closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from \
ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, \
the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights \
of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to \
make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received. \
\
\'93The men where you live,\'94 said the little prince, \'93raise five thousand roses in the same garden \
and they do not find in it what they are looking for.\'94 \
\
\'93They do not find it,\'94 I replied. \
\
\'93And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, that is true,\'94 I said. \
\
And the little prince added: \'93But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart...\'94 \
\
I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the colour of honey. And that \
honey colour was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief? \
\
\'93You must keep your promise,\'94 said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more. \
\'93What promise?\'94 \'93You know, a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower...\'94 \
\
I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and \
laughed as he said: \
\
\'93Your baobabs, they look a little like cabbages.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh!\'94 I had been so proud of my baobabs! \'93Your fox, his ears look a little like horns; and they are \
too long.\'94 And he laughed again. \
\
\'93You are not fair, little prince,\'94 I said. \'93I don\'92t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors \
from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\
\'93Oh, that will be all right,\'94 he said, \'93children understand.\'94 \
\
So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn. \
\
\'93You have plans that I do not know about,\'94 I said. But he did not answer me. He said to me, \
instead: \'93You know, my descent to the earth... Tomorrow will be its anniversary.\'94 Then, after a \
silence, he went on: \'93I came down very near here.\'94 And he flushed. \
\
And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, \
however, occurred to me: \'93Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you \'97 a \
week ago \'97 you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited \
region? You were on the your way back to the place where you landed?\'94 \
\
The little prince flushed again. And I added, with some hesitancy: \'93Perhaps it was because of the \
anniversary?\'94 The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions, but when one \
flushes does that not mean \'93Yes\'94? \
\
\'93Ah,\'94 I said to him, \'93I am a little frightened...\'94 \
\
But he interrupted me. \'93Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for \
you here. Come back tomorrow evening...\'94 \
\
But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets \
himself be tamed... \
\
Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next \
evening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall, with his feet \
dangling. And I heard him say: \'93Then you don\'92t remember. This is not the exact spot.\'94 Another \
voice must have answered him, for he replied to it: \'93Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the \
place.\'94 \
\
I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, \
however, replied once again: \'93...Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have \
nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.\'94 \
\
\
\
I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing. After a silence the little prince \
spoke again: \'93You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?\'94 I \
stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand. \'93Now go away,\'94 said \
the little prince. \'93I want to get down from the wall.\'94 \
\
I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall... and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing \
the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to \
an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. \
But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of \
a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones. I \
reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow. \
\
\'93What does this mean?\'94 I demanded. \'93Why are you talking with snakes?\'94 \
\
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had \
given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at \
me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a \
dying bird, shot with someone\'92s rifle... \
\
\'93I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,\'94 he said. \'93Now you can go \
back home\'94 \
\
\'93How do you know about that?\'94 I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, \
beyond anything that I had dared to hope. \
\
He made no answer to my question, but he added: \'93I, too, am going back home today...\'94 Then, \
sadly, \'93It is much farther... it is much more difficult...\'94 I realised clearly that something \
extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and \
yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing \
to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away. \
\
\'93I have your sheep. And I have the sheep\'92s box. And I have the muzzle...\'94 \
\
And he gave me a sad smile. I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little. \
\
\'93Dear little man,\'94 I said to him, \'93you are afraid...\'94 He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. \
But he laughed lightly. \
\
\'93I shall be much more afraid this evening...\'94 \
\
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not \
bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh \
water in the desert. \
\
\'93Little man,\'94 I said, \'93I want to hear you laugh again.\'94 But he said to me: \'93Tonight, it will be a \
year... my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago...\'94 \
\
\'93Little man,\'94 I said, \'93tell me that it is only a bad dream, this affair of the snake, and the meeting- \
place, and the star...\'94 But he did not answer my plea. \
\
He said to me, instead: \'93The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen...\'94 \'93Yes, I \
know...\'94 \
\
\
\
\
\'93It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the \
sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, I know...\'94 \
\
\'93It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink \
was like music. You remember, how good it was.\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, I know...\'94 \
\
\'93And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show \
you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for \
you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens... they will all be your friends. And, \
besides, I am going to make you a present...\'94 He laughed again. \
\
\'93Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!\'94 \
\
\'93That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water...\'94 \
\
\'93What are you trying to say?\'94 \
\
\'93All men have the stars,\'94 he answered, \'93but they are not the same things for different people. For \
some, who are travellers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the \
sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But \
all these stars are silent. You, you alone, will have the stars as no one else has them\'94 \
\
\'93What are you trying to say?\'94 \
\
\'93In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all \
the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... you, only you, will have stars that can \
laugh!\'94 \
\
And he laughed again. \'93And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be \
content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And \
you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... and your friends will be properly \
astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, \'91Yes, the \
stars always make me laugh!\'92 And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that \
I shall have played on you...\'94 \
\
And he laughed again. \'93It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of \
little bells that knew how to laugh...\'94 \
\
And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious: \'93Tonight, you know... do not come,\'94 said \
the little prince. \
\
\'93I shall not leave you,\'94 I said. \
\
\'93I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not \
come to see that. It is not worth the trouble...\'94 \
\
\'93I shall not leave you.\'94 \
\
\
\
But he was worried. \'93I tell you, it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes, they \
\
\
\
\
are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun...\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93I shall not leave you.\'94 \
\
But a thought came to reassure him: \'93It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.\'94 \
\
That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. \
When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He \
said to me merely: \'93Ah! You are there...\'94 And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying. \
\'93It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be \
true...\'94 \
\
I said nothing. \
\
\'93You understand... it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.\'94 \
\
I said nothing. \
\
\'93But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells...\'94 \
\
I said nothing. He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort: \'93You know, it will be \
very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars \
will pour out fresh water for me to drink...\'94 \
\
I said nothing. \
\
\'93That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five \
hundred million springs of fresh water...\'94 And he too said nothing more, because he was crying... \
\
\'93Here it is. Let me go on by myself.\'94 And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, \
again: \'93You know, my flower... I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She has four thorns, \
of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world...\'94 \
\
I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer. \'93There now, that is all...\'94 \
\
He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move. There was nothing \
but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. \
He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand. \
\
And now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. \
\
The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told \
them: \'93I am tired.\'94 Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say, not entirely. But I know \
that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a \
heavy body... and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells... \
But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add \
the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. \
\
So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the \
flower... At one time I say to myself: \'93Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass \
globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully...\'94 Then I am happy. And there is \
sweetness in the laughter of all the stars. \
\
\
\
\
But at another time I say to myself: \'93At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is \
enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any \
noise, in the night...\'94 And then the little bells are changed to tears... Here, then, is a great \
mystery. \
\
For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if \
somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has eaten a rose... Look up at the \
sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? \
\
Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes... And no grown-up will \
ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance! This is, to me, the loveliest and \
saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it \
again to impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and \
disappeared. Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some \
day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for \
a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and \
who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort \
me. Send me word that he has come back. \
